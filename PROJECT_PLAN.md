# Project Plan — Cardine

## Task Lifecycle

```text
[ ] TODO -> [/] IN_PROGRESS -> [x] DONE
```

## Vision

Cardine is the delivery discipline for AI coding agents. Every task lands on
`main` validated, integrated, and reversible, or it stops with a reason and the
exact command to resume. The scope of 1.0 is
[docs/ADR_CARDINE_1_0.md](docs/ADR_CARDINE_1_0.md).

## Origin

This repository starts from the code of Meridian 1.4.0
(<https://github.com/biagiolibe/meridian>, tag `v1.4.0`). Meridian's history,
task records, and design reports stay in that repository. Until `cardine run`
can deliver its own tasks, Cardine is developed with the Meridian 1.4.0 Lean
Delivery workflow that this import carries.

## Active Delivery

The work items to 0.9 are listed in the ADR.

- `[x]` 001 — Make the evidence tests independent of Meridian task records.
- `[x]` 002 — Add `pyproject.toml` and the `cardine` package skeleton.
- `[x]` 003 — Plan the split of `meridian.py` into the Cardine modules.
